# Test Engineer Assignment
This is an assignment to test a simple TODO app which I divided into 2 projects

1. **Simple_automated_todoscript** : This project covers the the critical functionality of the app using direct selenium functions to run
each function to test the app. each step has a coment above explaining what the code intends to achieve

2. **Feautures**: This project is an expansion of the first project(simple_automated_todoscript) using behaviour driven development(BDD) framework where the tests where developed based on 
what action we wanted to perform on the app.This approach is better, in that we can scale up our test suite to accommodate more test cases/scenarios
by introducing page object programming(POM) to the framework to enable reusable code in a larger and robust structure which will be easy 
to maintain and manage
